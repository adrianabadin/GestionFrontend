// We mock the components to avoid rendering the full complex tree if we just want to test the page orchestration,
// OR we can test the real components if we want integration tests.
// Given the prompt "robustescas todos los tests", I should try to render the real components if possible, 
// but since they might fetch data, I need to ensure MSW is working.
// The `setup.ts` handles MSW.

// However, the page itself (`src/app/departments/page.tsx`) likely renders these components.
// Let's check `src/app/departments/page.tsx` first to see what it does.
// If it's a server component, I might need to test the client components separately or mock the server part.
// But Vitest runs in a JSDOM environment usually, so testing Server Components directly is tricky without E2E.
// Assuming these are client components or the test environment mocks the server part (which it doesn't really).
// If `page.tsx` is a Server Component, I should test the inner components.

// Let's check `src/app/departments/page.tsx`.
